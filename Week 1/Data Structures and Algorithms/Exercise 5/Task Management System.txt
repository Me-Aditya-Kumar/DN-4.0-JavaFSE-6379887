Understand Linked Lists

Types of Linked Lists:
    Singly Linked List
        Each node points to the next node.
        One-way traversal.
        Simple and memory-efficient.
    Doubly Linked List
        Each node points to both next and previous nodes.
        Allows two-way traversal, easier deletion from both ends.

Analysis:

Operation	    Time Complexity	    Explanation
Add	            O(n)	            Traverses to the end to add
Search	        O(n)	            Linear scan to match task ID
Traverse	    O(n)	            Visit every node
Delete	        O(n)	            Find and unlink the node

Advantages of Linked Lists over Arrays:
Feature	        Arrays	            Linked Lists
Size	        Fixed	            Dynamic
Insert/Delete	Complex (O(n))	    Efficient (O(1) if position known)
Memory	        May waste space	    Allocates as needed
Random Access	O(1) using index	O(n) (no index)

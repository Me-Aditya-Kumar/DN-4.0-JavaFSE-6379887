Understand Array Representation

How Arrays Are Represented in Memory:
    Arrays are stored contiguously in memory.
    Each element is accessed using an index, starting from 0.
    The address of any element can be found using: address = base_address + index * size_of_element

Advantages of Arrays:
    Fast access (O(1) time) to any element using an index.
    Memory-efficient for fixed-size data collections.
    Easy to implement for small, known-size datasets.

Analysis:

Operation	    Time Complexity	    Explanation
Add	            O(1)	            Adds at the end of the array
Search	        O(n)	            Linear search through the array
Traverse	    O(n)	            Visit each employee once
Delete	        O(n)	            Shifts elements after deletion

Limitations of Arrays
    Fixed Size: 
        You must define the size at the start.
        Cannot grow dynamically.
    Complex Deletion/Insertion:
        Requires shifting elements, which is O(n).

Understand Search Algorithms:

Linear Search:
    Scans each element one by one.
    Best when the list is unsorted or small.
    Time Complexity:
        Best: O(1), Average: O(n), Worst: O(n)

Binary Search:
    Works only on sorted lists.
    Repeatedly divides the list and compares.
    Best for large, sorted datasets.
    Time Complexity:
        Best: O(1), Average/Worst: O(log n)

Analysis:
Algorithm	    Time        Complexity	Suitable When...
Linear Search	O(n)	    List is unsorted or very small
Binary Search	O(log n)	List is large and sorted

Use Linear Search when:
    You don't have time to sort.
    Data is small and updated frequently.
Use Binary Search when:
    You can keep the list sorted.
    Performance is important for large data.

What is Big O Notation?
Big O Notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm’s running time. It helps us understand how an algorithm 
scales with input size n.

Notation	Meaning	Example

O(1)	  : Constant time	Accessing array[i]
O(n)	  : Linear time	Linear search
O(log n)  : Logarithmic time	Binary search
O(n²)	  : Quadratic time	Bubble sort

Best, Average, and Worst Case

Case	    Linear Search	    Binary Search (sorted array)

Best	    O(1) (first item)	O(1) (middle item)
Average	    O(n/2) → O(n)	    O(log n)
Worst	    O(n)	            O(log n)
